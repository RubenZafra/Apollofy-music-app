## Description

Hi! In this project we tried to recreate the famous `Spotify` app. We used our own DB via json server to try all the different possibilities with `Tracks`, `Playlists`, etc. We built our own 
personal music player from scratch, not using any other library. For this project we wanted to try something different so we made it with `Typescript` and `Scss` mixed with `TailwindCSS` to further develop our skills as developers.
<br>
This `React` project was made with `Vite` and is purely the `Frontend` of the app although it has already all the functionality for once we add the `Backend` side of the project. It is fully responsive and compatible with mobile. 
<br> 
You can click on any card to start playing the music and also you can clic on the little heart icon to add it to your favorite playlist!
<br><br>
We are fixing some minor bugs and working on the backend side of the projects these next weeks.
